For tlsstuff creation, and replacing it with your own materials, see:
* https://github.com/ronpscg/vnc-rdp-pki-creation-for-weston
	* There is a video explaining it more details in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB7tkViEzbc&list=PLBaH8x4hthVysdRTOlg2_8hL6CWCnN5l-&index=92
  
The relevant videos, and context to this layer and distro are in youtube as well, before and after the playlist mentioned above.


Please note the git log - it explains what are the configuration changes done (e.g. to weston.ini) and how to modify your wifi password, should you want to include the wifi quick connect hack (and then you would want to add the recipe to local.conf - or use the example distro)
