# meta-weston-remote Yocto Project layer  (or: A nicer looking README for Github display)
This readme was added to not break the README nicely generated by `bitbake-layers`

The main components here are:
* Everything needed to make Weston work with VNC and RDP (see everything under *recipes-graphics*, and *recipes-kernel*)
* A very simple template to autoconnect to WiFi (see everything under *recipes-connectivity/hacky-wlan0-connect*)
* A very simple template to expose your device as an ADB (Android Debug Bridge) device

This does not support *systemd* in the way that you would expect, and it is intentional. However it does support it in a very useful educational way, given some requests from the audience.
(the main reason is some systemd exercise in my Yocto Project course. The other reason is PscgBuildOS which is not built with the Yocto Project)

Please note the git log - it explains what are the configuration changes done (e.g. to weston.ini) and how to modify your wifi password, should you want to include the wifi quick connect hack (and then you would want to add the recipe to local.conf - or use the example distro)

The relevant videos, and context to this layer and distro are in youtube as well, before and after the playlist mentioned above.
