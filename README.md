# meta-weston-remote Yocto Project layer  (or: A nicer looking README for Github display)
This readme was added to not break the README nicely generated by `bitbake-layers`

There are two main components here:
* Everything needed to make Weston work with VNC and RDP (see everything under *recipes-graphics*)
* A very simple template to autoconnect to WiFi (see everything under *recipes-connectivity/hacky-wlan0-connect*) 

This does not support *systemd* and it is intentional (the main reason is a systemd exercise in my course. The other reason is PscgBuildOS which is not built with the Yocto Project)

**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGakHmf-aBA&list=PLBaH8x4hthVysdRTOlg2_8hL6CWCnN5l-&index=95

Please note the git log - it explains what are the configuration changes done (e.g. to weston.ini) and how to modify your wifi password, should you want to include the wifi quick connect hack (and then you would want to add the recipe to local.conf - or use the example distro)

	* There is a video explaining it more details in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB7tkViEzbc&list=PLBaH8x4hthVysdRTOlg2_8hL6CWCnN5l-&index=92
  
The relevant videos, and context to this layer and distro are in youtube as well, before and after the playlist mentioned above.
